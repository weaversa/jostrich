# Act I, The Cage

Fed up with living in a cage that is too clean for a pre-teen, Jimmy
decides to make a mess. He hops around the cage scattering his many
things everywhere. Yes. His _many many_ things. This blatant display
of aggression and messiness alert the cleaning fish who promptly open
the cage door and start to clean.
