# Act I, The Cage

Jimmy waits patiently for the cleaner fish to finish cleaning his
cage. Unfortunately, they spend all day cleaning (they are very slow),
leaving the door wide open the whole time. When the last fish finishes
cleaning for the day, leaving and closing the cage door, Jimmy wonders
why he didn't take his only chance to escape. Oh well, there'll be
Christmas again next year.

Jimmy failed miserably at his quest.
