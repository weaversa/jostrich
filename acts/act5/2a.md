# Act V, Find a Plane

You give the demon a (not-at-all) painful static shock. The demon
glares at you with a stare that pierces deep into your metalic heart.

> Welcome aboard

says the demon. You board the shadow-dimension plane and arrive at shadow-Earth just in time for Christmas. Fortunately you get to see all of your friends and family, but unfortunately, they can't see you. Since you're in the shadow-dimension you only exist as a shadow in the real world...muhhahahaha!
