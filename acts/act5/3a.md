# Act V, Find a Plane

You follow the red-suited ostrich through a doorway marked "No
admittance", down a dark hallway, through a dimly lit tunnel, and out
onto a private part of the tarmac. Standing in front of you is a sled
with 8 shiny robot reindeer.

> This may be hard to understand, but I'm Santa and I need you, Jimmy, to guide my sleigh tonight. Will you help me?

What do you say?

  * ["I guess so"](./5a.md)
  * ["Awww...do I have to?"](./5a.md)
  * ["Do I really have a choice?"](./5a.md)
