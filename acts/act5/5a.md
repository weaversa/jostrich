# Act V, Find a Plane

You take the lead on Santa's sleigh and help him deliver presents
throughout the universe on Christmas Eve. As the time comes to deliver
presents on Earth, you start to wonder what will happen when you
arrive at your own home.

As the sleigh lands on your roof Santa turns to you and asks if you'd
like to do the honors, delivering the presents to the family below. As
you climb down the chimmney you hear Santa's sleigh take off into the
night.

> Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas Jimmy!
